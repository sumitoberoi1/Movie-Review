# Server

## Dependencies

* NodeJS v10.15.0
* Redis Server v5.0.4
* Python v3.7.3
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* argparse
* redis
* Additional NPM dependencies in `package.json`

For Linux systems `python`, `pip`, `python3`, and `pip3` are different commands. As this project depends on __Python 3__, all commands where `pip` or `python` are mentioned must use `python3` or `pip3` respectively.

The following commands can be used to install dependencies for the server:

```
npm install
pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn argparse redis
```

__Note that `pip` and `npm` must be run separately.__

## Compilation

The following commands can be used to compile and run the server:

```
npm start
```

The server expects that a Redis process is already running and listening on the default port of `6379`.

# Client

## Dependencies

* NodeJS v10.15.0
* Additional NPM dependencies in `package.json`

## Compilation

The following commands can be used to install dependencies and run the client:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

The client expects that its complimentary server is already up and running before it is executed.
