# Server

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* Flask
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn

## Compilation

For Linux systems `python`, `pip`, `python3`, and `pip3` are different commands. As this project depends on __Python 3__, all commands where `pip` or `python` are mentioned must use `python3` or `pip3` respectively.

The following commands can be used to install dependencies for the server:

```
pip install Flask, pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn
```

# Client

## Dependencies

* NodeJS v10.15.0
* Additional NPM dependencies in `package.json`

## Compilation

The following commands can be used to install dependencies and run the client:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
