## Phrase matcher demo
Speak the phrase and then see if the recognition engine successfully recognises it â€” this is another demo that relies on speech recognition, written for a research team at the University of Nebraska at Kearney.

This current works only on Chrome/Chrome Mobile. To get this code running successfully, you'll need to run the code through a web server (localhost will work.)
